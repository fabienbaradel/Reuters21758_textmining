Last exercise of CS909Data mining

We will find three R code in this repository. First, you need to open the R code called 'preprocessing&vectoisation'. It talks about all the steps of data preprocessing, feature engineering (bag of words, LDA).

Then, you can open the file called 'classification'. You will find all the text classification process.

Finally, you will find the file named 'clustering'. There is inside the three clusterings we have used and their analysis.

These R code are completed by a report that is available on the website link of this repository.

Enjoy.
